## Specifies gem version of Rails to use when vendor/rails is not present

## Bootstrap the Rails environment, frameworks, and default configuration

  ## Settings in config/environments/* take precedence over those specified here.
  ## Application configuration should go into files in config/initializers
  ## -- all .rb files in that directory are automatically loaded.

  ## Add additional load paths for your own custom dirs
  # config.load_paths += %W( #{RAILS_ROOT}/extras )

  ## Specify gems that this application depends on and have them installed with rake gems:install
  # config.gem "bj"
  # config.gem "hpricot", :version => '0.6', :source => "http://code.whytheluckystiff.net"
  # config.gem "sqlite3-ruby", :lib => "sqlite3"
  # config.gem "aws-s3", :lib => "aws/s3"
  # config.gem 'rack'
  config.gem "json"
  config.gem "builder"

  ## Only load the plugins named here, in the order given (default is alphabetical).
  ## :all can be used as a placeholder for all plugins not explicitly named
  # config.plugins = [ :exception_notification, :ssl_requirement, :all ]

  ## Skip frameworks you're not going to use. To use Rails without a database,
  ## you must remove the Active Record framework.
  # config.frameworks -= [ :active_record, :active_resource, :action_mailer ]

  ## Activate observers that should always be running
  # config.active_record.observers = :cacher, :garbage_collector, :forum_observer

  ## Set Time.zone default to the specified zone and make Active Record auto-convert to this zone.
  ## Run "rake -D time" for a list of tasks for finding time zone names.
  config.time_zone = 'Pacific Time (US & Canada)'

  ## Use the database for sessions instead of the cookie-based default.
  config.action_controller.session_store = :active_record_store

  ## The default locale is :en and all translations from config/locales/*.rb,yml are auto loaded.
  # config.i18n.load_path += Dir[Rails.root.join('my', 'locales', '*.{rb,yml}')]
  # config.i18n.default_locale = :de
  
  ## Force all environments to use the same logger level
  # config.log_level = :debug
